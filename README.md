# Board Games
## Project Overview
We have recently found some data on board games and decided to work on this topic because board game data is interesting and fun to work on with all the different ways in which people win and think about these games. Something that is different in board game data compared to other online games is how raw it can be. With online games, we only end up with data created through technology itself. However, with board games, the data that we collect are all non-technological. One type of data in our dataset that is not technological are the literal averages of ratings from real life people.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze the various data points presented in the board game dataset and see if we can find any correlations between those data points on either the games' ratings or the games' complexity to create a model that could predict what makes a good game.

## Resources
- Raw Data: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/board-games/version/2
- Data Source: BoardGameGeek.com
- Software: Excel 365, Python 3.6.1

## Description & Links of Datasource
The website "BoardGameGeek.com" allows users to rank board games on a scale of 1-10, and the site presents an average rating based on those individual ratings. This data is a collection of all ranked games in the BGG database.

## Questions To Answer
We hope to be able to answer questions related to game ratings and complexity such as...
- How complex the games are according to people's ratings of the games?
- What are the games' maximum amount of players?
- What are the games' average play time?
- What are the games' average complexity?
- Can we reasonably and accurately predict the average game rating?

## Challenge Summary
Something that we had a bit of trouble at first was finding a dataset that is reliable and interesting to work on. Another thing that we had a bit of trouble with was getting our data into pgAdmin because when we tried running the data in Jupyter Notebook, there was an error saying psycopg2 does not exist. However, we were able to resolve this by putting in "pip install psycopg2-binary" into the pythondata terminal that we used to open Jupyter Notebook.

# Communication Protocols
We reach out to each other on Slack and decided on a day and time in which we all agreed to meet up on each week from now on, 3PM on Fridays. Whenever a question arises, we would ask eachother and if we all end up not knowing the answer, then we ask our captain, Savannah.
